# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

In this case, I create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript. I am using validation checks to implement the game features. The UI is designed using CSS so it is easy to create. In the game, Player-1 starts playing the game and both players make their moves in consecutive turns. The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.

## Prerequisites

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of the following files:
